## The Contributing Guide

Do you have some knowledge you would like to share? Fix some errors or typos? Or maybe you have a spare star to give? Don't hesitate to write issues and open pull requests! Here are some guidelines on how to contribute to the project:

#### Style
The style of the wiki should be kept consistent on all articles.
* Avoid using ordered lists, if the order of the points is not important. This can minimize the amount of Merge Conflicts.
* The first line must be a title of the article, the second, a link to go back to the parent article, and third must be empty.
* Keep all the resources (pictures, etc) in the `/assets` directory.
* Make sure all articles are approachable even for people with very limited knowledge, provide links to articles about all mentioned concepts.
* Provide full examples, examples are usually the best way to describe something.

_This article, and the wiki as a whole is still very WIP, expect unannouced changes._
