## Textures
[Back](json.md)

Textures in minecraft are stored in `.png` files, in a location specified by models or game code e.g. `/assets/minecraft/textures/block/dirt.png`. The texture can be annotated with `.mcmeta` (JSON) files, they can be used to add special attributes and animations to the texture.  

For example a `.mcmeta` file for the texture `textures/block/dirt.png` would look like this: `textures/block/dirt.png.mcmeta`.

#### Animations
Animations are used to split a single texture into multiple sections and make them display in sequence.
