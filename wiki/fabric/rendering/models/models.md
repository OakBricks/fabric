## Models
[Back](../../fabric.md)

Models are meshes that are baked into chunk geometry on rebuilds (when chunks are modified) in vanilla they are always static and loaded from JSON model files, but fabric allows for dynamic models that are generated in code.

* [Model Loading](loading.md)
* [Model Providers](provider.md)
* [Unbaked Models](unbaked.md)
* [Baked Models](baked.md)
* [Rendering](rendering.md)

_The usage of the term "Model Loading" is a little exercise of creative freedom, as the real name "Model Provider" is hard to work with. A more descriptive name was chosen for the purpose of clarity._
